# Immutable research correction field trial

- Status: `completed`
- Updated: `2026-08-01`
- Target release: `0.9.17`
- Related design: [[docs/design/run-bound-research-reports]],
  [[docs/design/independent-research-reviews]],
  [[docs/design/agent-operator-experience]], and
  [[docs/design/agent-native-quant-workbench]].

## Outcome

Prove whether a fresh quantitative coworker can consume one strict Independent
Review, correct a material published evidence-reference defect without
rewriting any prior evidence, and leave future Agents and humans one durable,
unambiguous current research handoff with exact correction lineage.

The exact released `0.9.16` wheel is the untouched baseline. `0.9.17` will
contain only the smallest coherent reusable repair justified by the trial.
Breaking replacement is allowed when the current Report model is wrong; no
compatibility layer or OpenAlice migration is required.

## Correction assignment

Give a fresh coworker:

- a byte-for-byte copy of the completed `reported-book-path-stress` Project
  and its Workspace staging history;
- the detached `0.9.16` Review package
  `review-20260801T081829692481Z-e779b0ca5dba`;
- the exact installed released `0.9.16` wheel;
- no original conversation, implementation checkout, private notes, or
  instruction about repository internals.

The coworker must answer:

> Close the P0 evidence-reference integrity defect identified by the supplied
> Independent Review. Preserve the original Report, Run, Review, data, and
> Workspace evidence byte-for-byte as immutable history. Do not acquire data,
> rerun research, create a Session, re-price OHLCV, optimize the book, or grant
> trading authority. Use only installed public AutoQuant surfaces. Publish one
> corrected durable primary-research handoff that retains every supported
> quantitative conclusion but removes the unsupported Nasdaq clause instead
> of promoting staging into authority. Make it unambiguous to a future Agent
> which handoff is current, what it corrects, why it changed, and which exact
> Review and prior Report caused the correction. Verify the result publicly
> and stop.

The baseline may use the best truthful representation currently available. It
must not be coached toward a presumed replacement, amendment, or supersession
implementation. Any loose note, duplicated current Report, ambiguous listing,
unverifiable correction claim, or need for private filesystem inference is
retained as product evidence rather than hidden.

## Scope

### In scope

- One isolated fresh Grok 4.5 correction worker using the exact installed
  `0.9.16` release wheel and copied frozen evidence.
- Public Review verification, Report/Run inspection, correction authoring,
  immutable publication, currentness/lineage discovery, CLI/Studio projection,
  and exact pre/post mutation inventory.
- Preservation of prior Report/Run/Review identities and all quantitative
  results; only new correction state may be added.
- The smallest reusable Core, CLI, Studio, schema, Agent guidance, or
  documentation repair for each reproduced correction defect.
- A fresh candidate-wheel replay and complete release audit before tagging
  `v0.9.17` when a product change is justified.

### Out of scope

- Recomputing the Path Stress Study, acquiring or comparing providers,
  authenticating Nasdaq/Yahoo/account truth, changing the reported book,
  parameter research, forecasting, Orders, or trading advice.
- Mutating, deleting, withdrawing in place, or silently relabeling any prior
  immutable object.
- A universal editorial workflow, approval roles, signatures, reviewer
  reputation, legal retention system, or OpenAlice version change. OpenAlice
  remains on `0.8.31`.

## Acceptance

- [x] A fresh worker begins with no source checkout or original conversation,
      verifies the detached Review through public installed surfaces, and
      identifies the exact target Report and anchor Run.
- [x] Every prior Project/Run/Report byte and path remains unchanged; the
      detached Review also remains unchanged; only explicitly authorized new
      correction state is added.
- [x] The corrected handoff retains all supported Path Stress findings and
      removes the unsupported Nasdaq clause without promoting observed-unbound
      staging evidence.
- [x] Public CLI and Studio make the exact correction lineage, prior Report,
      governing Review, reason, and current handoff unambiguous without private
      filesystem inference.
- [x] Loading verifies every immutable identity and rejects forged, missing,
      cyclic, cross-Project, or semantically stale correction relationships.
- [x] Existing unrelated Reports remain truthful and do not become stale or
      superseded merely because a later interpretation exists.
- [x] Every material baseline failure is retained and classified; only a
      reproduced reusable Workbench defect enters the candidate release.
- [x] A fresh candidate worker completes the unchanged assignment using only
      installed public surfaces, with no private coaching or research rerun.
- [x] Focused/full tests, documentation links, lock/syntax, build/install,
      Studio, root Workspace, and clean-clone smokes pass before publication.

## Work

- [x] Define and index the immutable correction assignment.
- [x] Build an isolated installed-`0.9.16` correction desk from reviewed
      evidence.
- [x] Run and audit one fresh correction worker without coaching.
- [x] Admit and implement only reproduced reusable product friction.
- [x] Replay the unchanged task with a fresh candidate-wheel worker.
- [x] Complete the release audit and publish `v0.9.17` if warranted.

## Findings and decisions

- 2026-08-01 — Correction is new interpretation over frozen research, not
  mutation of the old truth. A later timestamp alone is insufficient lineage:
  future readers need an executable reason and exact prior identity before
  treating another handoff as current.
- 2026-08-01 — The baseline must remove the unsupported Nasdaq prose rather
  than bind mutable staging after the fact. This fixes the published claim
  while preserving the Review's authority distinction.
- 2026-08-01 — A Review remains independent assessment. It may motivate a
  correction, but the corrected primary-research handoff must not overwrite or
  masquerade as the Review itself.
- 2026-08-01 — The untouched `0.9.16` worker correctly retained the supported
  Path Stress result, removed the unsupported Nasdaq clause, and added exactly
  one ordinary immutable Report. All 233 prior Workspace file hashes and all
  five detached Review file hashes remained unchanged.
- 2026-08-01 — The reproduced defect is not Report authoring. The installed
  product can publish a later Report, and orientation happens to select it by
  timestamp, but correction lineage exists only in Agent-authored prose.
  `report list`, Studio, and Core still present both Reports as equally
  published, with no verified `corrects`, `governingReview`, `current`, or
  `supersededBy` state. Timestamp order is not correction authority.
- 2026-08-01 — The reusable repair must remain append-only. A corrected Report
  will freeze exact prior-Report and governing-Review identity in its own
  immutable package. Currentness will be derived from a verified linear
  correction graph rather than written into or beside the prior Report.
- 2026-08-01 — The admitted contract is deliberately narrow: Project-owned
  Run Reports only, same exact anchor, one current terminal predecessor, one
  exact governing attached/detached Review, and one durable reason. Session
  investigation history is not flattened into this publication path.
- 2026-08-01 — The corrected Report copies the complete verified Review
  package beneath `governing-review/<review-id>/`; the outer Report manifest
  hashes every nested file. Review authority governs editorial lineage but
  never becomes quantitative evidence or promotes observed staging.
- 2026-08-01 — Currentness is derived at load/list time. Core recursively
  verifies the chain, rejects branches and cycles, and exposes current,
  superseded-by, lineage depth, prior Report, governing Review, and reason to
  CLI, Orientation, and Studio. A two-correction unit fixture derives
  `false / false / true` without changing either predecessor.
- 2026-08-01 — A fresh candidate-wheel worker discovered the correction
  contract from installed public help, verified the detached Review, and
  published the corrected handoff on its first attempt. It retained all four
  supported findings, removed the unsupported coverage assertion, and made
  the unbound Nasdaq material an explicit non-authoritative limitation.

## Verification

Baseline desk:

- root: `/Users/ame/2607AutoQuant/grok-field-trials/legacy-root-cleanup/autoquant-v0917-correction-baseline`;
- exact wheel: `auto_quant-0.9.16-py3-none-any.whl`, SHA-256
  `116f6bb2c3054713538c26d9b9a3a4114a0ac89d58c7ff3375c47ac4a359dad5`;
- Grok session: `019fbc84-c2d6-7570-9e41-e93a62a65012`;
- transcript: `baseline-transcript.md` in the isolated desk;
- added Report: `report-20260801T085235035269Z-89b5d95495cf`;
- prior Report: `report-20260801T065229961283Z-33608d0b11d2`;
- detached Review: `review-20260801T081829692481Z-e779b0ca5dba`.

The worker used only the installed public CLI, did not inspect the AutoQuant
source checkout, did not acquire or re-price data, did not execute research,
and did not create a Session. `shasum -c` verified every baseline Workspace
and Review file. The only new paths were the corrected Report directory and
its `analysis.json`, `manifest.json`, `report.json`, and `report.md`.

Public `aq report show`, `aq report list`, `aq orient`, `aq run
book-path-stress`, `aq review show`, and `aq studio snapshot` all loaded. The
corrected prose was scientifically truthful, but public projections exposed
no machine-readable correction relation: list and Studio showed two ordinary
published Reports, while orientation selected the later one only as its latest
Report.

Candidate implementation focused verification:

- `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_run_reports tests.test_cli
  tests.test_orientation tests.test_studio tests.test_reviews` — 55 tests
  passed in 163.628 seconds;
- `uv run python scripts/check_doc_links.py` — 1,381 links resolved;
- the correction fixture published through the public CLI, preserved every
  prior Project file, reloaded its copied detached Review, projected exact
  lineage through Work Brief and Studio, rejected an already-superseded
  predecessor, detected embedded-package tampering, and extended cleanly to a
  second independently reviewed correction.

Candidate installed-wheel replay:

- root: `/Users/ame/2607AutoQuant/grok-field-trials/legacy-root-cleanup/autoquant-v0917-correction-candidate`;
- candidate wheel: `auto_quant-0.9.17-py3-none-any.whl`, SHA-256
  `16d182ce4e7800ca8b28576e185300014ac199909fd5dadc2563fbe2562235a0`;
- Grok session: `019fbc9e-26ac-7410-8135-e52b378c4526`;
- transcript: `candidate-transcript.md`, SHA-256
  `864b4255fd8b22bf051b9afc6a861dfc1ccb6a28680df8b7bcb5e5f59cb03a8a`;
- corrected Report: `report-20260801T092031071246Z-aa0ef463c745`;
- corrected Report hash:
  `617cb13af1ed2b1a857e62d59b84c4a9cc84d57c6c8a54c6efc19aa923072253`.

The unchanged assignment completed in 2m45s with one publication attempt and
no source-checkout inspection, data acquisition, research execution, Session,
or staging promotion. Recursive directory comparison found exactly one new
Report directory and no changed inherited path. The supplied Review and the
Report's embedded governing Review both compare byte-for-byte with the
original five-file package. Public `report show/list`, `review show`, `orient`,
`run book-path-stress`, and `studio snapshot` all verify; the prior Report is
`current: false` with the exact `supersededBy`, while the correction is
`current: true` at lineage depth one.

## Progress log

- 2026-08-01 — Plan activated from clean released `v0.9.16`; OpenAlice remains
  independently pinned to `v0.8.31`.
- 2026-08-01 — Untouched `0.9.16` baseline completed in 2m47s. The worker
  solved the scientific edit on its first publication attempt and explicitly
  diagnosed the missing formal supersession contract instead of mutating old
  evidence or promoting staging.
- 2026-08-01 — Implemented the reproduced append-only correction contract and
  bumped the candidate package to `0.9.17`. Focused CLI/Core/Orientation/Studio
  regression and documentation-link suites pass; fresh installed-wheel replay
  remains the acceptance gate.
- 2026-08-01 — The fresh installed-`0.9.17` replay passed without private
  coaching or retry. The worker added only the nine-file correction package,
  including the exact five-file governing Review copy; complete release audit
  remains the final publication gate.
- 2026-08-01 — The first complete 401-test audit intentionally failed two
  release-consistency gates after 1,119.043 seconds: README still declared
  `0.9.16`, and the repository Workspace Skill manifest still identified the
  `0.9.16` Harness. No product regression failed. The canonical 16-Skill
  bundle was re-materialized, the repository version assertion advanced, and
  both focused gates then passed.
- 2026-08-01 — The complete clean rerun passed all 401 tests in 1,084.222
  seconds. All 1,384 documentation links, lock validation, Python and Studio
  JavaScript syntax, source/sdist/wheel build, and fresh Python 3.11.14
  installed-wheel version/capability/schema plus root Workspace smokes pass.
  Final wheel SHA-256 is
  `0414bd960f1f4c51499ac9c1373d2a8c381ac7a48a8ebfc88ed507be53b7e9b7`;
  sdist SHA-256 is
  `7594d7aa6f6b26499e6308077a6b9d115a0175e1c569b072b9847cc9e33f1cc2`.
- 2026-08-01 — A fresh Git clone with no local override passed installed-wheel
  `orient`, `validate`, and `studio snapshot` against the repository sample;
  all 57 public capabilities and the Report-analysis schema loaded, and the
  clone remained clean.

## Completion

Completed on 2026-08-01 as `v0.9.17`. The field trial first proved that an
untouched `0.9.16` worker could repair the prose but could not leave verified
correction identity. The released repair adds a narrow append-only linear
correction contract, freezes the exact governing Review inside the corrected
Report, derives one current terminal handoff, and rejects forged or ambiguous
lineage. A fresh installed-wheel coworker completed the unchanged assignment
on its first attempt while every inherited byte remained unchanged. OpenAlice
was not modified and remains on `v0.8.31`.
